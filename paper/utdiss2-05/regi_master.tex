This paper takes the performance of lyrical folksongs as an opportunity for an exploratory corpus phonetics study of syllable prominence using the Estonian language, which has three syllable quantities, a predictable stress pattern at the word level and a robust tradition of folksongs {\it regilaul} which follow a strict metrical pattern. Using a novel semi-automatic computational annotation method, beat detection algorithms used in live music performance are used to determine the location and duration of the strong beats in a sung performance of a song.  Combined with acoustic analysis and natural language processing tools, this paper compares rhythmic prominence in songs with the  prominence pattern of the language. Using this method, I analyze the acoustic effect that becoming lyrics has on well established acoustic correlates of rhythmic prominence in Estonian compare the attested primary stress system and ternary quantity contrast documented in Estonian with the prescribed rhythmic pattern of an ancient folksong known as {\it regilaul}.  Results show that vowel duration is utilized as a prominence cue in both the song and word level. We also examine the long and overlong syllable quantity contrast in the context of the song, and find that the contrast between these two is not preserved in the temporal structure of the song.

The paper first introduces prosodic prominence in general, then delves into the metrical specifics of Estonian and its folksong tradition. After outlining the research questions, the methods section describes the corpus of {\it regilaul} songs: its construction, annotation, and processing. Investigating whether the established acoustic correlate of stress and quantity in spoken Estonian (duration) are preserved after undergoing subordination to the strict temporal properties of the structure of a song.

was born in Sarasota, Florida on 11 July 1990. Her early career was as a songwriter and recording artist, releasing several full-length albums combining digital and analog recording methods over the last decade. 

In 2018 she received the Bachelor of Arts degree in Linguistics from the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Upon graduation, she moved to Austin with her partner, Kavi, and taught English as a Second Language (ESL) to adults until her admission into the PhD program in the department of Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin, where she matriculated in Fall 2019.

%and was commissioned an Officer in the United States Air Force in 1971.
%He entered active duty in October, 1971, and was stationed in Denver, Colorado,
%Colorado Springs, Colorado, Panama City, Florida, and Sacramento, California.

%``remote'' engineer designing parts of the Alexis satellite for Los Alamos
%National Laboratories. Laid off when his portion of the satellite was
%completed, he applied to the University of Texas at Austin for enrollment
%in their physics program. He was accepted and started graduate studies in
%August, 1991.
