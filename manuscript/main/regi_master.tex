This paper presents an empirical analysis of acoustic-phonetic measurements of sung Estonian lyrics using an oscillator-entrainment model. Entrainment is the process by which two independently oscillating systems with differing periods interact and assume the same period. 
Measurements were extracted from {\it a capella} recordings of traditional Estonian folksongs called {\it regilaul} \(/re.ki.laul/\), which is part of the ancient indigenous oral tradition of Balto-Finnic {\it runosong}. Verse lines are composed using trochaic tetrameter, or four measures of syllable-note pairs with the downbeat corresponding to the first syllable-note. In nominally isochronous notes, the absolute durations of notes falling off the beat are shorter compared with their counterparts on the beat. Conversely, Estonian demonstrates foot isochrony such that the duration of the second syllable is inversely proportional to that of the first. Additionally, an increase in syllable duration is an acoustic correlate of primary stress in native Estonian words, which is fixed word-initially. This results in syllable-notes grouped across word boundaries in the song. Previous studies of regilaul found the absolute durations of syllable-notes patterned into two categories based on musical grouping rather than word grouping. In light of these results, I further investigate the strength of the entrainment of musical and linguistic rhythms at the sub-syllabic level, the alternation of consonant and sonorant phoneme segments. Results show that word-level stress and unstress is evident in the vowel durations of syllable-notes off the musical beat, but not apparent in syllable-notes that are on the beat. Therefore, when musical trochees cross word boundaries, word-initial syllables are acoustically distinct from pen-initial syllables.
