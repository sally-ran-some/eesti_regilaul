It is argued here that confining the application of the PVI to the level of the syllable (or its components) misses the essence of Estonian rhythm and indeed of phonetic rhythm in general, and the first experiment reported in this paper quantifies Estonian rhythm in terms of the durational PVI of both the syllable and (innovatively) the foot. In the second experiment, results are compared with the same measures for another language with strong stress, English. Both languages have a similar, relatively low foot PVI, but English has a considerably higher syllable PVI reflecting its radical reduction of unstressed syllables in polysyllabic feet.},

We discuss methods based on the use of explicitly predefined signal features: the signal's amplitude envelope, spectral magnitudes and phases, time-frequency representations; and methods based on probabilistic signal models: model-based change point detection, surprise signals, etc. Using a choice of test cases, we provide some guidelines for choosing the appropriate method for a given application.},

We first investigated ``global'' talker characteristics (e.g., gender, FO and speaking rate). Findings showed female talkers to be more intelligible as a group than male talkers. Additionally, we found a tendency for FO range to correlate positively with higher speech intelligibility scores. However, FO mean and speaking rate did not correlate with intelligibility. We then examined several fine-grained acoustic-phonetic talker-characteristics as correlates of overall intelligibility. We found that talkers with larger vowel spaces were generally more intelligible than talkers with reduced spaces. In investigating two cases of consistent listener errors (segment deletion and syllable affiliation), we found that these perceptual errors could be traced directly to detailed timing characteristics in the speech signal. Results suggest that a substantial portion of variability in normal speech intelligibility is traceable to specific acoustic-phonetic characteristics of the talker. Knowledge about these factors may be valuable for improving speech synthesis and recognition strategies, and for special populations (e.g., the hearing-impaired and second-language learners) who are particularly sensitive to intelligibility differences among talkers.},

In the digital era, a number of analytical tools have been designed which may serve to solve some of the problems related to the use of the score as a method for describing and visualizing music. These tools allow analyses to be performed, which were virtually impossible for most ethnomusicologists until a few decades ago. Praat, the well known software developed by Paul Boersma and David Weenink and designed for phonetic studies, may also be helpful for the annotation and analysis of the singing voice.

In this paper  we assume that syllable weight is reflected in moraic structure, and that weight-bearing coda consonants are the exclusive dependents of a mora, while weightless consonants share a mora with the preceding vowel. We consider whether the durations of vowels and coda consonants reflect the distinction between a segment which occupies its own mora and a segment that shares a mora. We examine three patterns of coda weight, reflected  in stress assignment: in Hindi, codas always contribute to syllable weight;  in Malayalam, coda consonants are always weightless; and in Levantine Arabic, coda weight is contextually determined, with word-internal codas contributing to syllable weight following a short vowel, but weightless following a long vowel. These phonological patterns translate into different moraic representations of CVC and CVVC syllables across the different languages. We examine the durations of vowels and coda consonants in CV, CVC, CVV and CVVC syllables in Hindi, Malayalam and Levantine Arabic, and find that in all three languages, segments that we represent as mora-sharing are significantly shorter than segments that we represent as occupying an independent mora. The striking differences in durational patterns across the three languages correlate with the different moraic representations proposed on the basis of phonological patterning.}

During the history of Estonian nationhood, these needs have been guided first and foremost by forms of political authority: during years of independence, the festivals were to serve different purposes than under imperial or Soviet Russian rule. Thus, the concept of 'singing oneself into a nation', popular in Estonian history textbooks, is only partly true. Although the performance of the festival changes only slightly through the years, its political significance changes enormously.},

We found that the speech and music rhythmic patterns were similar within each dialect but different across dialects.

Primary test domains are formed of non-pitched percussive (NPP) and pitched non-percussive (PNP) sound events. 16 detection functions are investigated, including a number of novel and recently published models. Different detection functions are seen to perform well in each case, with substantially worse onset detection overall for the PNP case. It is contended that the NPP case is effectively solved by fast intensity change discrimination processes, but that stable pitch cues may provide a better tactic for the latter.},

  abstract = {The following paper comprises three main parts. In the initial part we present a concise review of the data concerning Estonian word prosody. The data found in the literature raise new questions. In the second part some of these questions are tested by perception experiments. We succeeded in showing the existence of only two (short vs. long), not three phonological quantity degrees on segmental and syllabic levels. All three accents (traditionally called syllabic quantity degrees) can be identified only when information about the second syllable vowel has been delivered to listeners. The smallest prosodic unit in Estonian does not coincide with the syllable. Disyllabic accent feet are minimal distinctive prosodic units in Estonian. The main region of the stress foot, essential for the perception of accent types, consists of the stressed syllable rhyme (minimally its final part, i.e. the final half of the long nucleus or the coda peak) and of the nucleus of the following unstressed syllable. The concentration of the perceptually relevant informtition around the syllable boundary creates a perceptual impression that the long heavy accent (A3) has always a certain kind of peakedness whereas the long light accent (A2) has not. Besides segmental durations, listeners need additional information for the identification of accents embedded in a wider context than is delivered by the stressed syllable alone. All A3 feet are either vowel-peaked or consonant-peaked, other possibilities are lacking. In an unbalanced A3 disyllabic foot the perceptual effect of peakedness is strengthened against the background of the weakened, shortened, and qualitatively reduced second syllable vowel. The balance of A2 becomes conspicuous against the background of the lengthened and unreduced second syllable vowel. Accents, as the minimal distinctive prosodic units, ar closely connected with the stress pattern of a word. The domain of accents is a stress foot, irrespective of whether the foot is primarily or secondarily stressed. In the stress foot there operate two temporal regulation mechanisms. The higher-level temporal regulation, determined by the stress for the whole stress foot (up to trisyllabic feet), is expressed in an isochronic trend according to which addition of phonemes to the stress foot decreases the durations of the constituent segments in the foot, but does not affect accents. The lower-level temporal regulation mechanism, subordinated to the whole stress foot, characterizes isochrony of the accent foot. A stress-conditioned trend to isochrony influences absolute durations of the intrasyllabic constituents, whereas an accent-conditioned temporal regulation (e.g. inversely propor tional duration relations) expresses intersyllabic accent-characteristic temporal reorgani zation of the constituents in isochronous accent feet. In the final part of the paper we present the main principles of a conceptual framework for the description of Estonian word prosody.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that Estonian has a three-way quantity distinction among disyllabic word structures in terms of the ratio of the duration of first syllable compared to the duration of the second syllable. The present study examines the ability of Estonian speakers and American English speakers to discriminate among a set of duration ratios independent of other phonetic factors such as fundamental frequency or segmental variations. Subjects were required to discriminate among pairs of noise bursts whose durations were in the ratios of 1 : 2, 2: 3, 3: 2 and 2 : 1. In half the noise sequences the combined duration of noise 1 + noise 2 was 350ms, in the other half the combined duration was 450 ms. The results obtained show that both groups of listeners clearly recognized only two contrastive patterns: 1 : 2 and 2 : 3 vs. 3 : 2 and 2 : 1. In addition, overall sequence duration had a significant effect upon duration ratio discrimination. In terms of a language group difference, the Estonian and English groups differed only in terms of responses to very different ratios (e.g. 1 : 2 vs. 2 : 1; 2 : 3 vs. 2 : 1), in particular, the Estonian group produced fewer errors. The data support a reanalysis of the three-way quantity contrast into two distinct binary decisions: one based on quantity (short\textendash long vs. long\textendash short disyllabic structures) and one possibly based on fundamental frequency differences.},

Jackendoff, 1983). In Experiment 1 (n = 123), listeners representing a wide range of musical training heard two familiar nursery-rhyme melodies and one unfamiliar tonal melody, each presented three times. During each repetition, listeners indicated the location of boundaries between units by pressing a key. Experiment 2 (n = 33) repeated Experiment 1 with different stimuli: one familiar and one unfamiliar nursery-rhyme melody, and one unfamiliar, tonal melody from the classical repertoire. In all melodies of both experiments, there was good within-subject consistency of boundary placement across the three repetitions (mean r = .54). Consistencies between Repetitions 2 and 3 were even higher (mean r = .63). Hence, Repetitions 2 and 3 were collapsed. After collapsing, there was high between-subjects similarity in boundary placement for each melody (mean r = .62), implying that all participants parsed the melodies in essentially the same (though not identical) manner. A role for musical training in parsing appeared only for the unfamiliar, classical melody of Experiment 2. The empirical parsing profiles were compared with the quantified predictions of Grouping Preference Rules 2a (the Rest aspect of Slur/Rest), 2b (Attack-point), 3a (Register change), and 3d (Length change). Based on correlational analyses, only Attack-point (mean r = .80) and Rest (mean r = .54) were necessary to explain the parsings of participants. Little role was seen for Register change (mean r = .14) or Length change (mean r = \textendash\^a.09). Solutions based on multiple regression further reduced the role for Register and Length change. Generally, results provided some support for aspects of A Generative Theory of Tonal Music, while implying that some alterations might be useful.},

Similar to the intelligibility and memory benefits found in previous studies, enhanced acoustic-phonetic cues of the listener-oriented clear speech could improve speech segmentation by statistical learning compared to conversational speech. Yet, it could not be precluded that hyper-articulated clear speech, reported to have less pervasive coarticulation, would result in worse segmentation than conversational speech. We tested these predictions using an artificial language learning paradigm. Listeners who acquired English before age six were played continuous repetitions of the `words' of an artificial language, spoken either clearly or conversationally and presented either in quiet or in noise at a signal-to-noise ratio of +3 or 0 dB SPL. Next, they recognized the artificial words in a two-alternative forced-choice test. Results supported the prediction that clear speech facilitates segmentation by statistical learning more than conversational speech but only in the quiet listening condition. This suggests that listeners can use clear speech acoustic-phonetic enhancements to guide speech processing dependent on domain-general, signal-independent statistical computations. However, there was no clear speech benefit in noise at either signal-to-noise ratio. We discuss possible mechanisms that could explain these results.},

To overcome these problems, we have proposed four different kinds of analyser: an automatic timespan tree analyser (ATTA); a fully automatic time-span tree analyser (FATTA); the {$\sigma$} GTTM analyser, which detects local grouping boundaries by combining GTTM with statistical learning using a decision tree; and the {$\sigma$} GTTM-II analyser, with which we introduce full parameterization and statistical learning.},

We find that in sung and chanted verse, an especially tight correspondence to the metrical pattern is imposed on linguistic material that is either bounded within a tight phrasal domain or located at the right edge of a high-level domain. These patterns have been observed earlier for spoken verse. But for the phenomenon of metrical inversion, the behavior of sung and chanted verse is quite different from spoken verse. We develop an explanation of the difference, based on the idea that inversion in sung and chanted verse occurs only in those cases where it is the best available metrical option.},

Analyzing those differences is essential in various fields particularly ethnomusicology which studies non-western music based on cultural context.

  abstract = {Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also has a clearly described ``pop-out'' effect, where an element with some extra feature is easier to detect among elements without an extra feature. This phenomenon is better known as auditory perceptual asymmetry. We investigated such asymmetry between shorter or longer duration, and level or falling of pitch, of linguistic stimuli that carry a meaning in one language (Estonian), but not in another (Russian). For the mismatch negativity (MMN) experiment, we created four different types of stimuli by modifying the duration of the first vowel [ɑ] (170, 290 ms) and pitch contour (level vs. falling pitch) of the stimuli words (`SATA', `SAKI'). The stimuli were synthesized from Estonian words (`SATA', `SAKI') and follow the Estonian language three-way quantity system, which incorporates tonal features (falling pitch contour) together with temporal patterns. This made the meaning of the word dependent on the combination of both features and allows us to compare the relative contribution of duration and pitch contour in discrimination of language stimuli in the brain via MMN generation. The participants of the experiment were 12 Russian native speakers with little or no experience in Estonian and living in Estonia short-term, and 12 Estonian native speakers (age 18-27 years). We found that participants' perception of the linguistic stimuli differed not only according to the physical features but also according to their native language, confirming that the meaning of the word interferes with the early automatic processing of phonological features. The GAMM and ANOVA analysis of the reversed design results showed that the deviant with longer duration among shorter standards elicited a MMN response with greater amplitude than the short deviant among long standards, while changes in pitch contour (falling vs. level pitch) produced neither strong MMN nor asymmetry. Thus, we demonstrate the effect of language background on asymmetric perception of linguistic stimuli that aligns with those of previous studies (Jaramillo et al., 2000), and contributes to the growing body of knowledge supporting auditory perceptual asymmetry.},

The system is general in regard to the sounds involved and was found to be robust for different kinds of signals. This was achieved without assuming regularities in the positions of the onsets. In this paper, a method is first proposed that can determine the beginnings of sounds that exhibit onset imperfections, i.e., the amplitude envelope of which does not rise monotonically. Then the mentioned system is described, which utilizes band-wise processing and a psychoacoustic model of intensity coding to combine the results from the separate frequency bands. The performance of the system was validated by applying it to the detection of onsets in musical signals that ranged from rock to classical and big band recordings.},

This is due to the duration distribution between the syllables: the first syllable increases with the degree of quantity and the second decreases. The amount of isochrony varies with speaking style: in conversational speech, foot duration is more dependent on the degree of quantity than in list reading. Moreover, in list reading the difference in foot duration between short and long quantity is greater than between long and overlong. The present paper shows that in conversational speech this is true only for words where the bearer of the quantity contrast is a vowel and the F0 contour can constitute an additional cue to overlong quantity. In words where the bearer of the quantity contrast is a consonant, the difference in foot duration is largest between long and overlong quantity. The rhythmic pattern in oral production of poetry is similar to that of conversational speech.},

In most generative accounts, morae simultaneously represent several layers of functionally and structurally diverse information. This brings along a considerable increase in formal analytical machinery and internal controversies. In a structural functional framework, morae can be used to formalise the prosodic contrast of long and short stressed syllables in Estonian. Its relevance is seen in actual functioning of the prosodic system. This contrast is built upon the segmental contrast of short and long phonemes and, in turn, serves as a basis for the contrast of two distinctive foot accents, light and heavy. As an example, a formal morphonological algorithm of calculating Estonian foot accents, which also shows the place of the syllable weight contrast, is proposed. (English)},

Speakers can, and typically do, tune their performance according to communicative and situational demands, controlling the interplay between production-oriented factors on the one hand, and output-oriented constraints on the other. For the ideal speaker, H\&H claims that such adaptations reflect his tacit awareness of the listener's access to sources of information independent of the signal and his judgement of the short-term demands for explicit signal information. Hence speakers are expected to vary their output along a continuum of hyper- and hypospeech. The theory suggests that the lack of invariance that speech signals commonly exhibit (Perkell and Klatt 1986) is a direct consequence of this adaptive organization (cf MacNeilage 1970). Accordingly, in the H\&H program the quest for phonetic invariance is replaced by another research task: Explicating the notion of sufficient discriminability and defining the class of speech signals that meet that criterion.},

British English is commonly described as stress-timed, but Singapore English is claimed to be syllable-timed. In the present paper, we explore the acoustic nature of the suggested cross-varietal difference. In directly comparable samples from British English and Singapore English, two types of acoustic measurements were taken; we calculateda variability index reflecting changes in vowel length over utterances, and measurements reflecting vowel quality. Our findings provide acoustic data which support the hypothesized crossvarietal difference in rhythmic patterning; we show(1) that successive vowel durations are more nearly equal in Singapore English than in British English, and(2) that reduced vowels pattern more peripherally in the F1/F2 formant space in Singapore English than in British English. We complete the paper with a comparison of our vowel variability index with a set of acoustic measures for rhythm proposed by Ramus, Nespor, and Mehler(1999), which focus on variability in vocalic and intervocalic intervals. We conclude that our variability index is more successful in capturing rhythmic differences than Ramus et al. (1999)'s measures, and that an application of our index to Ramus et al.'s intervocalic measure may provide a further diagnostic of rhythmic class.},

In this paper, the quantity-related variation of segment duration, pitch, and vowel quality was investigated in spontaneous Estonian in words occurring in sentence-medial position. While a disyllabic foot can be made up of a number of segmental combinations, the data showed that the quantity opposition operates independently of the segmental structure of the foot. The effect of the analyzed features was evaluated with a multinomial logistic regression model. The model showed that all the variables which were included had a significant effect. Besides the inverse relation of the stressed and unstressed syllable rhymes, which is traditionally used to describe the three-way opposition, syllable onset duration also had a weak effect. Additionally, vowel quality was significant for the opposition of short (Q1) and long (Q2), and pitch alignment was significant for the opposition of long (Q2) and overlong (Q3) quantities.},

Here, we investigated how specific musical expertise can mediate the relationship between movement and timing perception. In the present study, a group of highly trained percussionists (n~=~33) and a group of non-percussionists (n~=~33) were tested on their ability to detect temporal deviations of a tone presented after an isochronous sequence. Participants either tapped along with the sequence using a drumstick (movement condition) or listened without tapping (no-movement condition). Although both groups performed significantly better when moving than when listening alone, percussionists gained a greater benefit from tapping when detecting the smallest probe tone delays compared to non-percussionists. This complements both the musical expertise and timing perception literature by demonstrating that percussionists with high levels of training may further capitalize on the benefits of sensorimotor interactions. Surprisingly, percussionists and non-percussionists performed no differently when listening alone, in contrast to other studies examining the role of training in timing abilities. This raises interesting questions about the degree to which percussionists' known expertise in timing may interact with their use of motion when judging rhythmic precision.},

  abstract = {Ternary stress pattern\textemdash the lapse of more than one syllable between stresses\textemdash have been challenging for metrical stress theory. The existence of a ternary primitive predicts the existence of trisyllabic word minima, trisyllabic reduplicants, and most directly, stress on every third syllable. The alternative to a ternary primitive has its own predictions, such as the systematic skipping of one light syllable between metrical feet. As such, this, too, would predict the systematic occurrence of stress on every third syllable. Most of the world's languages that have stress are binary and show strict alternating rhythm on stress-bearing units, and so these ternary languages are somewhat problematic. This research shows that the predictions borne of a ternary primitive or its binary alternative do not hold. More specifically, that systems widely believed to be ternary are more uniformly identified as binary, with sporadic ternary effects under duress. This is particularly important, because we predict that the existence of those requirements that yield a ternary effect should apply across-the-board in some languages, and this prediction is shown not to hold. Evidence from Finnish, Estonian, and Koniag Alutiiq suggest that both the quantity of the individual syllable in specific contexts as well as the morphological status of certain syllables can be stress-attracting such that a binary rhythmic alternation can be interrupted to the extent that it appears ternary. Additional evidence from Old English and Bani-Hassan Bedouin Arabic, originally thought to be evidence of the binary equivalent of a ternary primitive, are shown to be well-formed binary systems whose sporadic ternary effects are predictable on the basis of requirements we know to hold in other languages. Finally, an examination of Sentani reveals that remaining instances of ternarity are predicted on the basis of the unusual application of requirements known to hold in other languages.},

  abstract = {This research investigates the utility of drum vibration data, as the input to beat-tracking algorithms. This approach presents a novel alternative to using either audio signals or MIDI/Virtual Score representations as a means of tempo following and subsequent tempo control. A prototype system: The Pulse has been developed as proof of concept for this approach. The system comprises one or more sensors connected to a microcontroller which runs beat detection and tempo tracking algorithms in real-time. This paper discusses scenarios where this approach benefits over existing approaches. As a means of quantitative evaluation, a methodology to compare the functionality of this sensorbased system to that of a contemporary audio signal-based system was also created in the form of a user study which was conducted with the results then analysed here. The conclusion of this project asserts that low-cost sensors, attached to either instruments or performers themselves during a live performance can be reliably used to detect the percussive onsets required by beat-tracking systems and the performance and accuracy of the prototype system is comparable with existing, audio-only systems.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the perception of Estonian duration-based phonological oppositions by native Estonians and non-native speakers with Russian-language background. The short/long category boundary was examined by varying the duration of a vowel in three contexts involving isolated vowels (V vs. VV), one-syllable nonsense words (CVC vs. CVVC), and two-syllable real words (CVCV vs. CVVCV). Since vowel duration serves to distinguish lexical minimal pairs in Estonian but not in Russian, L1 and L2 subjects are expected to employ different perceptual strategies in a short/long categorization task. In particular, location and width of category boundaries as well as consistency of categorization are likely to vary between the groups. The results showed that L2 subjects were quite successful in distinguishing the Estonian short/long categories despite the non-categorical use of the duration cue in their native language. As a rule, the L2 subjects demonstrated (1) category boundaries at longer durations, (2) larger width of category boundaries, and (3) lower consistency of responses compared to those of the L1 group. The perceptual strategies of L2 subjects might be based on the continuous auditory perception of the salient duration cue, or on the variable duration patterns associated with word stress in their L1, or on a combination of both strategies.},

This tutorial introduces Bayesian multilevel modeling for the specific analysis of speech data, using the brms package developed in R. Method  In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to Bayesian multilevel modeling by reanalyzing a phonetic data set containing formant (F1 and F2) values for 5 vowels of standard Indonesian (ISO 639-3:ind), as spoken by 8 speakers (4 females and 4 males), with several repetitions of each vowel. Results  We first give an introductory overview of the Bayesian framework and multilevel modeling. We then show how Bayesian multilevel models can be fitted using the probabilistic programming language Stan and the R package brms, which provides an intuitive formula syntax. Conclusions  Through this tutorial, we demonstrate some of the advantages of the Bayesian framework for statistical modeling and provide a detailed case study, with complete source code for full reproducibility of the analyses (https://osf.io/dpzcb/).

In this article,  however, an underlying iambic structure for the Old French  octosyllable is established through quantitative analysis of  a large corpus of texts written from c. 975 to 1180 (42 distinct  works, including over 22,000 lines). Because no texts conform  absolutely to the grammar of English iambic verse (Halle \&  Keyser, 1971; Kiparsky, 1977), certain measures are proposed  for the degree to which a sample deviates from the iambic pattern;  these values are then compared with the (chance) deviation of  normal Old French prose. A significant correlation emerges between  these measures and date of composition, author, and genre: early  texts are almost perfectly iambic, and late 12th-century texts  approach, but do not reach, chance levels. It is concluded that  the grammar of meter used by Old French authors underwent a  gradual change during the 12th century, a change comparable  to more familiar phonological and syntactic changes.},

The article examines which variants of musical rhythm and melodic contour are preferred by four singers in their performance of verses that have different functions within the song structure. In both the text and the musical rhythm, a greater number of syllables, and the attendant changes in musical rhythm, mark the verses that have an initiating function and which communicate entirely new information. In performing such verses, rather than the extension verses of parallelism groups or verse repetitions, in the short melodies with narrow pitch range, the singers prefer more ``intense'' variants of melody contours in which the higher notes of the scale are predominantly used. In two-line melodies, the singer's patterning of the song text is largely determined by the musical logic, attempting to align the beginnings of the melodic strophes and verse groups.},

This study explored how focus and word positioning affect f0 via a production experiment involving elicitation of laboratory speech.

This study uses a recentlydeveloped measure for the study of speech rhythm to compare rhythmic patterns in English and French language and classical music. We find that English and French musical themes are significantly different in this measure of rhythm, which also differentiates the rhythm of spoken English and French.

A one-to-one correspondence was found between syllables in the text and notes in the melody. The duration of more than 700 syllables was measured. Syllable duration was found to vary by a considerable amount. In spoken language, the three quantities of disyllabic Estonian words are signalled by characteristic ratios between the durations of the first and the second syllable (S1/S2 ratio), which have approximately the values of 0.67, 1.5, and 2.0 for short, long, and overlong degrees. In laments, the range of S1/S2 ratios was much smaller. The difference in S1/S2 ratio between long and overlong disyllabic words was nonsignificant in all three performances, and that between short and long words was nonsignificant in one performance. This tendency toward rhythmic regularity may be explained on the basis of the original activity-associated nature of the old folksong tradition.},

  abstract = {Durations of acoustical segments were measured in four Estonian folk songs sung by a single performer, consisting of 152 verse lines, eight syllables each, with one note in the melody normally corresponding to one syllable in the text. The results were analyzed with regard to three aspects: notation, meter, and speech prosody. Three songs out of four are notated as isochronous sequences of 8 eighth notes per each verse line; in one song, certain pairs of eighth notes are replaced by a dotted eighth note plus a sixteenth note. The results revealed a complex interaction between meter, musical rhythm, and speech prosody. Variations in durations of sound events reflect the Kalevala meter on which the songs are based, with average rises in a foot being acoustically longer than falls. The duration differences between rises and falls are reduced in the socalled broken lines, which contain monosyllabic and trisyllabic words and allow for accommodation of short stressed syllables at a fall of a foot as required by the meter. Semantically relevant oppositions of wordinitial short-long and long-short disyllabic units in speech are not kept completely intact in folk songs. Short-long disyllables are treated in a different manner by the performer, depending on whether their initial syllable occurs at a rise or at a fall in a foot.},

It was supposed that the singers' perception of melodicall y ac- cented points has shaped melody contours in oral tr adition, Melodic accents were probably used to accentuate le xical stresses. Lexical stress on the word's initial syllable is of central importance as a carrier of phonological inf orma- tion in Estonian. The coincidence of melodic accents with lexical str esses was examined for two types of verses: ordinary vers es that have lexical stresses on metrically strong position s, and broken verses that have (one or more) lexical stres s(es) on metrically weak position(s). It was assumed that le xical stresses, metric stresses and melodic accents are w ell syn- chronized in ordinary verses, but singers vary the melody contour in broken verses to increase melodic accent on metrically weak position(s) carrying lexically stre ss(ed) syllables.},

Hirschhausen (1827). TiU the 19th century it was difficult to realize that the duration was not a correlate of stress in Estonian. The Estonians' perception was of utmost importance in discovering the three quantity degrees, as the (supposed) first recording of three quantities in vowels ("Agenda Parva" 1622 by unknown author, presumably of South-Estonian origin) as well as their theoretical description (Masing 1824) were given by native speakers.},

  abstract = {Background in music psychology. Musical accent may be defined as an increased prominence ascribed to a sound event. Of the various types of accent proposed by music theorists, one of the most contentious has been the so-called 'melodic accent'. Huron and Royal (1996) have tested eight conceptions of melodic accent of three samples of music: Western folk music and art music, Gregorian chant. The results for all three studies were consistent with a perceptual model of melodic accent developed by Thomassen (1982). Although the correlation with Thomassen's model of melodic accent was significant, the effect magnitude was relatively small and emerged most clearly in unaccompanied isochronous solo passages. Background in ethnomusicology. Estonian folk songs called regilaul are ancient unaccompanied isochronous monophonic folk songs that differ from Western folk song tradition. Unaccompanied isochronous folk songs are also found in Lithuanian tradition, although they do not comprise homogeneous stylistic layer like Estonian regilaul. Some Estonian and Lithuanian tunes are varied in the course of singing, in terms of melodic contours. It is proved in the earlier work (S\"arg 2006) that melodic accent in interaction with lexical stress has an effect on shaping melody contour in regilaul. On purpose, singers synchronize melodic accents to lexical stresses both in metrically regular (ordinary) verses and in metrically varied (broken) verses. But still is the question why some melodies are not varied in the case of metrical variation. Aims. First, we aim to test the effect of Thomassen's model of melodic accent in Estonian contemporary melodies, composed in regilaul style and in Lithuanian unaccompanied isochronous folk songs. The second question is why there are several melodies in old regilaul tradition as well as in Lithuanian vocal tradition that usually remain invariable.},

The major goal of this paper was to establish the presence of the clear speech effect in production and perception of a language other than English, namely Croatian. A systematic investigation of the conversational-to-clear speech transformations across languages with different phonological properties (e.g., large versus small vowel inventory) can provide a window into the interaction of general auditory-perceptual and phonological, structural factors that contribute to the high intelligibility of clear speech. The results of this study showed that naturally produced clear speech is a distinct, listener-oriented, intelligibility-enhancing mode of speech production in both languages. Furthermore, the acoustic-phonetic features of the conversational-to-clear speech transformation revealed cross-language similarities in clear speech production strategies. In both languages, talkers exhibited a decrease in speaking rate and an increase in pitch range, as well as an expansion of the vowel space. Notably, the findings of this study showed equivalent vowel space expansion in English and Croatian clear speech, despite the difference in vowel inventory size across the two languages, suggesting that the extent of vowel contrast enhancement in hyperarticulated clear speech is independent of vowel inventory size.},

To date, segment durations in the two languages have not been systematically compared. This paper reports a necessarily explorative experiment with two primary goals: first, to compare the phonetic realisation of quantity in the two languages in selected word structures, and second, to relate the results on accentual lengthening to the predictions of a speech timing framework (White, 2002) that has been developed on the basis of observations in an essentially non-quantity language, namely English. It was observed, besides cross-language differences in the durational realisation of the three-way and two-way quantity contrasts that durationally C1, outside the quantity system in both languages, behaves differently in the two languages. It was also observed that the patterns of accentual lengthening in the two languages are highly consistent with predictions of the timing framework.},

A musical corpus analysis shows that the SS is common in both Scottish and English songs, but virtually nonexistent in German and Italian songs. We explore possible linguistic correlates for this phenomenon. Our reasoning is that languages in which stressed syllables are often short might tend to favor the SS pattern. The traditional distinction between long and short vowels correlates partly with the SS pattern across languages, but not completely. (German allows short stressed vowels, but the SS pattern is not common in German music.) We then examine the duration of stressed syllables in four modern speech corpora: one British English, one German, and two Italian. British English shows a much higher proportion of very short stressed syllables (less than 100 ms) than the other two languages. Four vowels account for a large proportion of very short stressed syllables in British English, and also constitute a large proportion of SS tokens in our English musical corpus. This is the first study known to us that establishes a correlation between speech rhythms in languages and musical rhythms in the songs of those languages.},

  abstract = {The Estonian language with its elaborate system of contrasts in quantity, whose essentials are described in the paper, is used to investigate human perception of distinctive contrasts in the duration of vowels, consonants and larger units. In the experiments reported, the speaking rate of a preceding or following syllable was manipulated in addition to that of a target V, C or VC sequence that carried a quantity distinction in disyllabic words. The results confirmed that the second syllable in such words, in particular the duration of its vowel, serves as a reference, but they showed segments of additional syllables to contribute in the same direction. The results provided no support for ascribing quantity to any larger units than phonetic segments. Speech rate effects of similar magnitude have been observed in Japanese, while effects of the same kind were found to be smaller in Dutch. These differences may be linked with the functions durational contrasts have in the different languages. It appears that listeners have to adapt more fully to variations in the local speaking rate when there are no additional cues and the functional load of quantity distinctions is high.},

Inari Saami is compared with other Saami and Finnic languages. Segmental durations, fundamental frequency and intensity are analysed. The results show a three-way distinction in consonant duration most robustly after a short stressed syllable vowel. In the case of a long stressed syllable vowel there is no difference between half-long and long geminates. In all of the analysed word structures, segments are inversely related to each other, as with an increase in consonant duration the durations of the surrounding vowels decrease. The fall in the fundamental frequency contour is less steep in words with a long geminate than in those with a short consonant or a half-long geminate. The intensity of the unstressed vowel decreases with the increasing quantity of the intervocalic consonant. The results indicate that the three-way quantity distinction in Inari Saami is primarily manifested by durational properties in a disyllabic foot, while fundamental frequency and intensity have a less important role.},

In all these languages the domain of ternary quantity is a disyllabic foot where the first syllable is stressed and the second syllable is unstressed. In this study we investigate the realisation of the ternary quantity contrast in Inari Saami disyllabic words with phonologically short and long vowels or diphthongs as the nucleus of the first syllable. Our results show that in consonant duration the ternary distinction occurs after a short vowel. The opposition is binary after a short diphthong (consonant is either short or long) and after a long vowel or a long diphthong (consonant is either short or half-long). A vowel in the unstressed second syllable compensates for the length of the preceding vowel and consonant within the foot.},

Similarly to Estonian and other Finno-Ugric languages where three quantities are described, in Inari Saami the distinction between single consonants, short geminates or consonant clusters, and long geminates or consonant clusters appears only on the boundary of a stressed and unstressed syllable of a disyllabic foot. Our results show that in Inari Saami the duration of consonants is inversely related to the duration of both preceding and following vowels, and there is a tendency towards foot isochrony. The results are in line with previous studies on quantity opposition in Inari Saami and in other Finnic languages, showing the ternary distinction of consonant quantities as a foot-level feature of the language.},

Design: Two experimental steps were carried out: (1) selection and perceptual optimization of the monosyllables; construction of 14 lists, (2) an evaluation of the lists in normal hearing (NH) children both in noise and in quiet. Study sample: Forty-three NH native speakers of Estonian (average age 7.9 years). Results: The reference psychometric curve for all lists combined both in noise and in quiet for NH children was determined, with the slope and speech reception threshold differing from the respective values of the Estonian adults in accordance with previous research. The 14 lists in noise as well as in quiet were proven to be of equal difficulty with very little variation in the SRTs averaged over the lists. Conclusion: The EWINc is a precise and reliable test for quantifying speech intelligibility in Estonian children. \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Speech segments are lengthened at the onsets and offsets of linguistic constituents. Final-syllable vowel lengthening is proposed to be a language-universal cue to word segmentation, but cross-linguistic investigations of the perception of initial consonant lengthening are lacking. We compared the use of word-initial consonant lengthening and word-final vowel lengthening by native speakers of English, Hungarian and Italian, using an artificial language learning task and varying vowel and consonant durations between subjects within each language group. Wordfinal vowel lengthening was only exploited for segmentation by English speakers; we interpret its nonuniversality as potentially due, at least in part, to language-specific functional loads on vowel duration, used for indicating lexical stress in Italian and vowel identity in Hungarian. By contrast, all three language groups used word-initial consonant lengthening to locate word boundaries, but did not benefit from lengthening of vowels in word-initial syllables. If domain-initial consonant timing effects are universal, it may be because they promote two related but separable processing requirements for the listener: (a) word segmentation, boosted by lengthening across the boundary; (b) lexical access, boosted by articulatory strengthening and lengthening of word onsets.},

For example, the Cantonese syllable /si/ means "teacher" when spoken in a high pitch and "yes" when spoken in a low pitch. How is fundamental frequency (Fo) used to signal lexical tones that occur in songs? In an examination of Cantonese songs, it was found that songwriters abandon the ratio scale of Fo differences that is applied to lexical tones in carefully read speech and instead use an ordinal scale. For example, a high tone that is normally 12\% higher than a mid-tone in speech can be realised as any higher Fo (but never a lower Fo) in songs. A perceptual experiment showed that native Cantonese-speaking listeners similarly apply an ordinal Fo scale to arrive at the lexical meaning of the lyric. This ratio-to-ordinal mapping in Cantonese songs ensures the musicality of the melody while preserving adequate identifiability of lexical tones in the lyric.},
