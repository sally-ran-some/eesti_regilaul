%This paper analyses the acoustic realizations of sung vowels in Estonian {\it regilaul} lyrical folksong performances to examine the effects of musical metrical structure on the word-prosodic level of the language. Estonian is of particular interest as it has a fixed, predictable word stress pattern and three  syllable weights. In light of these features, I compare documented acoustic correlates of both stress and syllable weight, and the effects of them falling ``on" or ``off" the beat within the trochaic tetrametric pattern of {\it regilaul}. Vowel space and duration of syllable nuclei is compared in stressed and unstressed syllables falling on and off the beat in song, and all three quantities in word-prosodic stressed position examined on and off the beat in the song.
