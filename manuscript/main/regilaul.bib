 abstract={Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

The study begins with an examination of the realization of the trochaeic pattern (bisyllabic feet accented on the first syllable) in Finnish, Estonian, Swedish, and Lithuanian. This is followed by a consideration of the relationship between metric feet and poetic lines. Stress-timing is illustrated with reference to Icelandic.},

A one-to-one correspondence was found between syllables in the text and notes in the melody. The duration of more than 700 syllables was measured. Syllable duration was found to vary by a considerable amount. In spoken language, the three quantities of disyllabic Estonian words are signalled by characteristic ratios between the durations of the first and the second syllable (S1/S2 ratio), which have approximately the values of 0.67, 1.5, and 2.0 for short, long, and overlong degrees. In laments, the range of S1/S2 ratios was much smaller. The difference in S1/S2 ratio between long and overlong disyllabic words was nonsignificant in all three performances, and that between short and long words was nonsignificant in one performance. This tendency toward rhythmic regularity may be explained on the basis of the original activity-associated nature of the old folksong tradition.},

The results were analyzed with regard to three aspects: notation, meter, and speech prosody. Three songs out of four are notated as isochronous sequences of 8 eighth notes per each verse line; in one song, certain pairs of eighth notes are replaced by a dotted eighth note plus a sixteenth note. The results revealed a complex interaction between meter, musical rhythm, and speech prosody. Variations in durations of sound events reflect the Kalevala meter on which the songs are based, with average rises in a foot being acoustically longer than falls. The duration differences between rises and falls are reduced in the socalled broken lines, which contain monosyllabic and trisyllabic words and allow for accommodation of short stressed syllables at a fall of a foot as required by the meter. Semantically relevant oppositions of wordinitial short-long and long-short disyllabic units in speech are not kept completely intact in folk songs. Short-long disyllables are treated in a different manner by the performer, depending on whether their initial syllable occurs at a rise or at a fall in a foot.},

The major goal of this paper was to establish the presence of the clear speech effect in production and perception of a language other than English, namely Croatian. A systematic investigation of the conversational-to-clear speech transformations across languages with different phonological properties (e.g., large versus small vowel inventory) can provide a window into the interaction of general auditory-perceptual and phonological, structural factors that contribute to the high intelligibility of clear speech. The results of this study showed that naturally produced clear speech is a distinct, listener-oriented, intelligibility-enhancing mode of speech production in both languages. Furthermore, the acoustic-phonetic features of the conversational-to-clear speech transformation revealed cross-language similarities in clear speech production strategies. In both languages, talkers exhibited a decrease in speaking rate and an increase in pitch range, as well as an expansion of the vowel space. Notably, the findings of this study showed equivalent vowel space expansion in English and Croatian clear speech, despite the difference in vowel inventory size across the two languages, suggesting that the extent of vowel contrast enhancement in hyperarticulated clear speech is independent of vowel inventory size.},

  abstract = {The H\&H theory is developed from evidence showing that speaking and listening are shaped by biologically general processes. Speech production is adaptive. Speakers can, and typically do, tune their performance according to communicative and situational demands, controlling the interplay between production-oriented factors on the one hand, and output-oriented constraints on the other. For the ideal speaker, H\&H claims that such adaptations reflect his tacit awareness of the listener's access to sources of information independent of the signal and his judgement of the short-term demands for explicit signal information. Hence speakers are expected to vary their output along a continuum of hyper- and hypospeech. The theory suggests that the lack of invariance that speech signals commonly exhibit (Perkell and Klatt 1986) is a direct consequence of this adaptive organization (cf MacNeilage 1970). Accordingly, in the H\&H program the quest for phonetic invariance is replaced by another research task: Explicating the notion of sufficient discriminability and defining the class of speech signals that meet that criterion.},
